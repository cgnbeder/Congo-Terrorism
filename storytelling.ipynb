Specifically, in Sub-Saharan Africa, the total GDP rose from 428.35 billion USD in 2000 to 2.03 trillion USD in 2023. As of 2023, the GDP rankings (in million USD) for Sub-Saharan African countries are as follows:\n- South Africa: 377,781.60\n- Nigeria: 362,814.95\n- Ethiopia: 163,697.93\n- Sudan: 109,327.02\n- Kenya: 107,440.58\n- Angola: 84,722.96\n- Tanzania: 79,158.29\n- Cote d'Ivoire: 78,788.83\n- Ghana: 76,370.39\n- Congo, Dem. Rep.: 66,383.29\n- Uganda: 49,272.88\n- Cameroon: 47,945.51\n\nAccording to this list, the Democratic Republic of Congo ranks 10th. Although there is a significant GDP gap between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the top 3 countries, the gap with the top 5 countries is not as substantial.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"862254e3-9168-459e-8223-0643ffd78b86"},{"source":"_**Figure 1: GDP of all African countries**_\n\n![Africa_GDP](plots/Africa_GDP.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a35c6ebe-9343-45e1-8709-a47a1ea43ae3"},{"source":"According to this graph, we see that the Democratic Republic of Congo has a higher GDP compared to the Sub-Saharan Africa average. However, it is not accurate to evaluate all African countries together due to various factors such as their locations, tourism revenues, internal conflicts, and underground resources.

Considering the impact of the Coronavirus on GDP in the years 2018-2020, we can say that the slight decline during this period is actually a misleading decline and that GDP growth has been continuous since 2010.\n\nAlthough it is not very accurate to draw a conclusion based solely on GDP data, we can say that the Democratic Republic of Congo is in a stable growth phase and will be one of the top two powers with the highest GDP in this region in the near future. However, as in every country, while one side strives for the development and progress of the country, various groups, organizations, or communities try various ways to slow down or stop this development. This is called terrorism.\n\nTerrorism is the use of violence to destabilize a country or region, spread fear, and achieve political, religious, or ideological goals. There are various types of terrorism: state-sponsored terrorism, religious terrorism, nationalist terrorism, and ideological terrorism. These types are carried out by groups with different motivations and usually target civilians. In developing countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, terrorism is a significant factor that threatens economic growth and social stability. Therefore, to minimize the effects of terrorism and ensure sustainable development, cooperation and strategies should be developed at national and international levels. However, before deciding on these strategies, it is necessary to compare the frequency of terrorism within the country with other neighboring countries, examine the types and targets of terrorism, and develop a solution-oriented plan based on these examinations.\n\nAlthough each type of terrorism requires different solutions, even though responding to force with force has become a common norm today, developing countries that are lagging behind other major states on the world stage need to approach solution-oriented measures more carefully. Today's public opinion is very influential in national politics, and it is also in the hands of countries to positively influence and guide this public opinion. Therefore, responding to force with force can, as a result of a possible misunderstanding in the world public opinion, show the right as wrong and the wrong as right. This situation can be effective in the politics of countries, and the types of terrorism believed to be ended by responding to force with force may be recognized as victims by other states or international communities and receive help. As a result, you may have to fight not only with terrorists but also with countries that misunderstand you and support the communities/organizations you are fighting against. This is not only militarily difficult, but even if victory is achieved, it results in a misunderstanding by other world states and communities and leaves a bad stain on the country's image.\n\nIn summary, although responding to terrorism with pure and disproportionate force may bring victory, it can create an illusion in the world public opinion and politics about which side is the terrorist, and the consequences of this situation are bad and not easily recoverable.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"dc3bccd2-52d8-4b4b-bd39-489b86349c62"},{"source":"## Terrorism\nMany countries aim to ensure security in the region, establish partnerships, and achieve joint development. The main point of achieving this is to ensure security within the country. Making the public feel safe and being perceived as a \"safe country\" in the eyes of other countries brings growth. However, terrorism is the biggest obstacle to security. While preventing and punishing crimes within the country does not require special competencies, detecting terrorism, raising awareness about it, and taking necessary actions require special competencies. These competencies can be acquired from scratch or obtained from other countries through knowledge trade. It is not correct to respond directly to the major problem of terrorism with force. For this, it is necessary first to understand and analyze the country's situation regarding terrorism and decide on the necessary steps to be taken.\n\nWhen examining the data, although the Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the top 10 countries in Africa in terms of GDP and has a steady rise, this growth also leads to an increase in groups that want to hinder the country's development and growth, resulting in a rise in terrorist activities. Democratic Republic of Congo, especially in terms of regional growth, is among the top 3 countries, but it is also the primary target for terrorist attacks.\n\n_**Figure 3: Pie chart of terror attacks by country**_\n\n![pie_chart](plots/pie_chart.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e774b76c-7cc8-4253-be69-ebac00e24768"},{"source":"When examining the data, the Democratic Republic of Congo has been the country most affected by terrorist attacks since 2011 compared to other countries on a regional scale. Following Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon with 854 terrorist attacks and Kenya with 717 attacks come next, with a difference of approximately 1.5 times between them.\n\nWhen we look at the connection between GDP and terrorist attacks, we see an inverse relationship. Although Kenya, which has the highest GDP among neighboring regions, is an exception by ranking third in the number of terrorist attacks, Angola and Tanzania, which have higher GDPs than Democratic Republic of Congo, are at the bottom of the list in terms of the number of terrorist attacks. Similarly, Zambia and Rwanda, which have GDPs close to that of Democratic Republic of Congo, are also at the bottom of the list in terms of terrorist attacks.\n\nThe conclusion to be drawn from this is that while Kenya could be one of the main countries for terrorist attacks due to its GDP size (ranking third on the attack list), Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon may be among the target countries because they have achieved above-average and stable growth in regional GDP stability. The stable rise of Democratic Republic of Congo along with Cameroon may not have been welcomed by various states, organizations, or groups, as the number of terrorist attacks is inversely proportional to GDP growth in many countries, but these two countries (especially Democratic Republic of Congo) are at the top of the list in terms of the number of terrorist attacks.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f84e1b9b-408d-4869-b9a1-25d6261d7abc"},{"source":"_**Figure 4: Sum of deaths by year and country**_\n\n![deaths](plots/deaths.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"33834214-dd73-47fe-8a70-3f0a5f9ea43f"},{"source":"Due to the fact that the Democratic Republic of Congo is at the top of the list in terms of the number of terrorist attacks, it may not be surprising that the death rates are equally high.

While the number of deaths due to terrorism in all other regional countries is decreasing, why is it increasing in the Democratic Republic of Congo?\n2. After the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon and then Kenya follow in terms of the number of terrorist attacks, but what is the reason for this difference in death rates?\n\nThere can be many different social or political reasons for these questions. However, the situation that needs to be focused on more than the reason is the solution. We can see the high number of terrorist attacks and the high number of deaths with two different visuals.

Similarly, with various types of training such as hostage rescue, indoor operations, building/person defense, and advanced driving, one can prevent hostage taking or gain an advantage in rescue operations after a hostage taking.

Particularly in the period after 2000, the Democratic Republic of Congo has risen rapidly and steadily, becoming one of the top 10 countries in Africa and one of the top 4 in its region as of 2020.\n\nHowever, since the beginning of human history, developing societies have become targets of certain groups and have been subjected to their attacks. Although this situation has not changed today, it has become more complex with technological developments and globalization, and these attacks have increased their range and potential damage by bringing along many different factors such as media, public opinion, and the influences of different geographical countries. The policy of responding to power with power has decreased especially after the Second World War and almost completely disappeared after the Cold War. Instead, the concept of \"security dilemma\" has led to the adoption of \"soft power\" methods, and countries have started to cause damage to their target countries through political means or by supporting various terrorist groups rather than participating in wars directly. In this context, countries now not only avoid losing their own citizens but also provide financial support to various groups to inflict this damage on their behalf.\n\nThis issue is very important. Because in today's world politics, it is impossible to understand who is a terrorist/terrorist organization, which state supports which organization, and which country the organization targets. This situation not only creates a false reputation in the media but also leads to the misdirection of public opinion by these false news, causing the public to pressure politicians and influence their policies in this context. States that cannot express themselves well and cannot attract the media and public opinion to their side may appear unjust in their rightful causes. Issues such as who the terrorist is, who is oppressing whom, and who is right or wrong can become confused, and despite being the right side, they can be severely punished in world politics, and groups like the terrorist groups they have been trying to eliminate for years can rise again with the help of international organizations/states and use this power more consistently and harmfully against them. Therefore, the issue of combating terrorism is very important.\n\nThe situation of the Democratic Republic of Congo regarding terrorism is not very good. The state, which is on the rise in terms of GDP, is at the top in terms of the number of terrorist attacks and deaths/injuries. In addition to identifying the problem, it is important to analyze the problem in detail, determine which type of terrorism is being fought, and then take the right action. In this case, another important factor is not responding to terrorism with terrorism. Professional and well-trained armies and teams should address this issue by applying proportional and equally effective force, not disproportionate force. In other words, it is necessary to ensure that the obtained equipment and tools are used correctly, in addition to the size of the equipment and tools provided. This approach will not only extend the usage period of the equipment but also allow for more efficiency. However, more importantly, it will give the image of a professional army and state fighting terrorism/guerrilla warfare in the world public opinion. As I have stated many times before, this situation is very important. In addition to providing the necessary equipment and training, attracting the public opinion to the side of the state will provide peace of mind in the fight against terrorism. It will also prevent the groups referred to as terrorist organizations from receiving moral support, especially financial support, and will cause individuals who would join terrorist groups to fear and not dare to fight against a professional and internationally supported state (you). This situation will lead to a significant reduction in terrorist attacks even without directly combating terrorism, and will cause terrorist organizations to break away from their former sizes and become smaller groups/parts that are easier to deal with. As the public feels safe, international support is provided, and the professional army has the necessary professional equipment and training, attacks on the business sector will also decrease, accelerating the existing stable rise economically and paving the way for becoming one of the top 2 countries in its region and one of the top 5 countries in Africa in the near future.\n\nAlthough the realization of all these does not depend solely on the fight against terrorism, combating terrorism is of great importance for accelerating the existing stable growth and achieving the stated goals in a shorter time. Effective combat against terrorism has two main pillars: good equipment and tools, and professional training.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"26d193b1-427a-4c89-8af2-7d2ebca580cf"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.12","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
